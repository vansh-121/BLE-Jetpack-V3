## 📱 Overview

**BLE-Sense** is an Android application developed using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It serves as a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) scanner, allowing users to discover and interact with nearby BLE devices. The app showcases modern Android development practices, including:

- **Jetpack Compose** for declarative UI
- **Kotlin Coroutines** for asynchronous operations
- **MVVM Architecture** for a clean separation of concerns
